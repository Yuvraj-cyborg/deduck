## 🛠️ Local Setup

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deduck.git
cd deduck
```

### 2. Build the CLI

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be generated at:

```bash
./target/release/deduck
```

### 3. (Optional) Add to Your PATH

To run deduck globally from anywhere:

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

This installs it to:

```bash
~/.cargo/bin/deduck
```

Make sure `~/.cargo/bin` is in your PATH:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc
source ~/.zshrc                                           # or source ~/.bashrc
```
## 📦 Usage

### 🧪 Scan Directory

```bash
deduck scan --dir /path/to/folder
```

### 🧠 Filter Duplicates (and choose scan mode)

```bash
deduck filter --dir /path/to/folder
```

### ♻️ Clean Duplicates (requires filter to be run first)

```bash
deduck clean
```

### 🔄 Restore Files

```bash
deduck restore
```

### 🗑️ Purge Quarantine Folder

```bash
deduck purge
```
## 📝 Saved State

- Last scanned directory is saved in `~/.deduck/last_dir.txt`
- Last scan mode is saved in `~/.deduck/scan_mode.txt`

## 🧪 Tests
